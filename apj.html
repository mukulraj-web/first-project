                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which

                    “Missile Man.”</strong><br><br> ☛ Among those successes
                    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched

                    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                    solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the tests caused great concern
                    in the international community.
                    <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called

                    a less-developed to a developed society
                    in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                    other measures, increasing agricultural
                    productivity, emphasizing technology as
                    a vehicle for economic growth, and
                    widening access to health care and
                    education.
